For example, royal courts have been a major source of fashion in the West, where clothes that are difficult to obtain and expensive to maintain have frequently been at the forefront of fashion.&nbsp;Ruffs, for example, required servants to reset them with hot irons and starch every day and so were not generally worn by ordinary folk. As such garments become easier to buy and care for, they lose their&nbsp;exclusivity&nbsp;and hence much of their appeal. For the same reason, when fabrics or materials are rare or costly, styles that require them in excessive, extravagant amounts become particularly fashionable&mdash;as can be seen in the 16th-century vogue for slashing outer garments to reveal a second layer of luxurious fabric underneath.</p>";s:9:"image_url";s:223:"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1488464/pexels-photo-1488464.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=750&w=1260,https://images.pexels.com/photos/3771088/pexels-photo-3771088.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=750&w=1260";s:13:"external_link";s:0:"";}i:1;a:11:{s:5:"title";s:29:"Modern grey couch and pillows";s:4:"slug";s:29:"modern-grey-couch-and-pillows";s:3:"sku";s:11:"CO-MD-69799";s:11:"category_id";s:1:"3";s:5:"price";s:7:"2549.90";s:13:"discount_rate";s:2:"15";s:8:"vat_rate";s:2:"10";s:5:"stock";s:3:"100";s:11:"description";s:808:"<p>Mauris volutpat elementum arcu dignissim mattis.
